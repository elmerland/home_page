		The creation of a web browser Snake game. This is a basic Snake game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus of this project is on the JavaScript part so the HTML and CSS files are fairly small. I go through all the steps of how I came to start this project and the details of how the JavaScript makes it work.
