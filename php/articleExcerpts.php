		Systems class is hard, and understanding the concepts is also hard. In doing the first assignment I found that there wasn’t a very good tutorial or source that outlined all of the concepts that are needed to complete the first assignment. This is why I wrote this article. It explains the basics of pipes and how to handle file descriptors across multiple processes. Specifically focusing on how to pipe input and output across multiple child processes.
