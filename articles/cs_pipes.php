					A <em>file descriptor</em> is an indicator that points to an input/output device. In other words a file descriptors is a pointer to an input/output device. These pointers can be modified, copied, created and closed.
				<br>
				<br>
					For example, when a new process is created by default it contains three file descriptors: <em>stdin</em>, <em>stdout</em>, <em>stderr</em>. <em>Stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> are write only file descriptors while <em>stdin</em> is read only. These three file descriptors all point to the terminal, meaning that any input or output will come from or be written to the terminal. What exactly are these file descriptors? They are represented by integers. By default <em>stdin</em> is equal to <em>0</em>, <em>stdout</em> to <em>1</em>, and <em>stderr</em> to <em>2</em>. We are not however, limited to these three. The next section will explain how to create new ones using pipes.
				<br>
				<br>
					Now that we know what a file descriptor is, lets examine where itâ€™s stored. Each process has a table called the <em>File Table</em>. This table stores all of the available <em>file descriptors</em> and the <em>pointer</em> to the input/output device. When a process wants to access one of these devices all it needs to do is reference the <em>file descriptor</em>. The kernel will then look at the <em>file table</em> inside of the process and get the pointer to the input/output device that is associated with the <em>file descriptor</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The image above shows how a process might have more than three <em>files descriptors</em>. In this case the <em>file descriptors</em> <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> are pointing to text files. Every time that the <i>fopen()</i> function is used this is what happens, a new file descriptor is created that is pointing to the file that is being written to or read from.

					<h2>Pipes</h2>

					The concept of a <em>pipe</em> builds on the <em>file descriptors</em>. Sometimes it is necessary to create a channel (pipe) of communication between two processes. The way this is done is by creating two new file descriptors that point to a pipe. The figure below gives a visual representation of what a pipe would look like in the context of file descriptors.
				</p>

				<img src="http://learncodeart.com/_images/article_src/pipe_dgm.png">

				<p>
					Notice that the pipe has two sides, one where the process writes to and the other where the process reads from. Therefore a pipe is just a way to move information from one point to another without having to involve files or other devices. This makes it easier for two processes to communicate each other.
				<br>
				<br>
					Keep in mind that a file descriptor to a pipe can be treated like a file pointer. Which means that you can use the <em>write()</em> and <em>read()</em> methods on it. The following example shows how to initialize and test a pipe:
				</p>

				<pre><?php include("http://learncodeart.com/_code/cs_pipes_1.c"); ?></pre>

				<p>
					As mentioned earlier a file descriptor is stored in the way of an integer. So when a pipe is created an integer array of size two is needed. By convention the integer element at index 0 is the read side and the integer element at index 1 is the read side. It is useful to declare the constants <em>IN</em> and <em>OUT</em> (alternatively STD_IN and STD_OUT) to make reading the code more human readable.
				<br>
				<br>
					The <em>pipe()</em> function is where all the magic happens. This function first creates a new <em>pipe</em> and then finds the two lowest available <em>file descriptors</em> and assigns them to the ends of the pipes. The function returns <i>0</i> when successful and <i>-1</i> when an error occurred. For more information please refer to the man page or this <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/pipe">site</a>. Alternatively this <a hre="http://linux.die.net/man/7/pipe">site</a> offers a more in depth discussion on pipes.
				<br>
				<br>
					There is something very important left out of this example that will be discussed in the next section. That being said, the above code shows how to go about creating a pipe between two processes and demonstrates that a pipe acts as any other input/output method, so it can be treated the same way a file pointer or an output to the terminal would be treated.

					In the previous section the code example that was shown was missing something very important. That something is the <em>close()</em> function. To understand why this function is needed lets have a little recap on what happens when a process is forked. 
				<br>
				<br>
					When the <em>fork()</em> function is called a new process is created by copying the state of the current process. The <i>child</i> process therefore inherits everything from the <i>parent</i>, including any <em>file descriptors</em>. Also worth noting is that the kernel keeps track of which file descriptors have an open connection to <i>all devices</i>. Meaning that if the parent process creates a new pipe and then forks a child process the kernel will know that both the child and parent have an open connection to the pipe. The following image represents the file table of the parent and child processes after the fork in the code example from the previous section:
				</p>

				<img src="http://learncodeart.com/_images/article_src/fork_dgm.png">

				<p>
					After the fork, the file table is duplicated in the new child node along with the file descriptors and their links. Now, suppose that the child node was only interested in writing something to the pipe and the parent process was only interested in reading from the pipe. This means that the child process has no need for the read end of the pipe (fd3), and the parent process has no need for the write end of the pipe (fd4). In addition to the parent process not needing access to fd4 there will also be another problem. Suppose that the child node creates some message and writes it to the pipe. Upon doing this it closes all of the file descriptors and exits. The parent process can now read from the pipe. The problem however is that the kernel will never send an EOF character through the pipe until all write file descriptors to the pipe have being closed. Since the kernel is aware that the parent process still has a connection to the write end of the pipe it will not send an EOF character and the parent process will not know when the message has ended.

					This is why we need the close() function. After the parent has forked the child process it should close the write end of the pipe. Doing this will ensure that as soon as the child process ends the kernel will send an EOF character through the pipe letting the parent process know that nothing more will be sent through the pipe. Similarly, the child process should close the read end of the pipe. The following image shows what the file descriptors will look after closing the unnecessary pointers:
