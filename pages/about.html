				My Name is Elmer Landaverde. Currently I am a senior at Virginia Tech, doing a double major in computer science and business management. But that’s the boring part. More to the point I am a guy who is passionate about learning. My interests vary from sociology, math, statistics to design, photography and aesthetics. Mostly however I just enjoy learning about different things to try and figure out this darn world we live in. Out of all my interests the one I focus on the most and have had the longest is in Computer Science. This passion started when I took my first Java class in high school and has being with me ever since. I hope some of what I write in this webpage is helpful to somebody but most of all this webpage is helpful to me because it serves as visual map of the projects that I embark on.

				The idea for this website has being long in the making. However it wasn’t until recently that I had to learn JavaScript for a research project I’m about to be part of, and because the most important part about learning is doing I figured it would be a good practice to finally create a web page to get some practice. This is how I came about to create this site. Initially I thought I would just make a <a title="Word Press" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> blog, but that ended quickly. Partly because I didn’t find a theme I liked, and mostly because typing it up your-self is more fun :)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The main purpose of this site is to write articles about the projects that I complete either for class or for pleasure. It will also serve to me as a visual representation of my progress across time and be a useful place for things that I forget and wish to remember. Never the less I do hope that this site can be helpful to someone other than me, and so I will put as much effort as I have time for into writing the articles for this site.

				Thanks for visiting my site and hope you find something that interests you!
